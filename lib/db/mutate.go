// Mutate is a read-modify-write combinator over SafeUpdate for a row that

// whenever the write loses the optimistic-concurrency race (ErrCASConflict)
// or finds the row's Postgres NOWAIT lock contended (ErrLockNotAvailable).
// Returns ErrObjectNotFound if the row does not exist — for a combinator
// that may also create the row, see MutateOrInsert. fn must not be nil (a
// nil fn is a plain error, checked before any I/O); unlike fn, a nil seed on
// MutateOrInsert is blessed — see its doc comment.
//
// Return contract: on success, obj is the value a subsequent SelectByID
// would observe, INCLUDING any WithCompute stamps — not fn's return value
// echoed back. SafeUpdate takes the object by value and stamps compute
// fields internally, so none of that stamping propagates back out of it;
// Mutate re-reads the row after a successful write to give an honest
// answer. The re-read is also the only faithful option on Postgres, where
// the JSONB column keeps nanosecond timestamps but the created_at/updated_at
// columns are microsecond-truncated — echoing fn's return value would drift
// from what a real subsequent read reports. On any error, obj is the zero
// value.
//
// Committed-write-with-error: an error return does not always mean nothing
// persisted. If the write itself committed but the post-write re-read
// failed (ErrObjectVanished, or a transient read error), the mutation IS
// durably applied even though Mutate returns an error — callers needing
// exactly-once effects must make fn idempotent, not assume "err != nil"
// implies "nothing happened".
//
// Freshness: the returned obj may already reflect a concurrent writer's
// later mutation — it is "what a subsequent SelectByID would observe", not
// "your write echoed back verbatim". A caller returning it directly in an
// HTTP response must not assume it is exactly what it just wrote.
//
// No-op skip (default behaviour): if fn returns an object byte-identical
// (canonical JSON marshal) to the row Mutate just read, Mutate performs no
// write at all — no SafeUpdate call, no re-read, no further attempts — and
// returns that row as of THIS read (not re-verified at return). updated_at
// is left untouched. Want a bump even when nothing meaningfully changed?
// Change a field before returning from fn — touch it to bump it. Note that
// the comparison is a plain marshal-byte compare: an fn that touches a
// WithCompute-owned field (e.g. re-stamps a timestamp a compute hook already
// owns) always looks changed to it, forcing a write even when business
// state is otherwise identical — the hooks then overwrite that touched
// field again on the way back out. Don't touch compute-owned fields from fn.
//
// fn contract: it may run up to mutateMaxAttempts times and must be pure or
// otherwise strictly retry-safe — no irreversible or externally visible side
// effects inside it. Those belong after Mutate returns success: persist
// first, then side-effect. That fn runs with no transaction open is an
// implementation detail useful for test machinery, not a licence for
// callers to do DB work inside fn. A fn error aborts immediately, with no
// retry.
//
// Before every fn call, the just-loaded row is deep-cloned via
// cloneViaJSON (marshal→unmarshal, same technique as SafeUpdate's own
// from-clone in update.go) to become SafeUpdate's `from` baseline. This
// guards against fn mutating its `cur` argument's slices/maps in place: a
// shallow copy would share backing arrays with that baseline and corrupt
// it, turning every attempt into a false conflict. As with SafeUpdate's
// clone, the marshal→unmarshal round-trip drops unexported fields
// (encoding/json's rule, not Mutate's) — same semantics callers already
// rely on. The clone happens before fn is invoked, so a MarshalJSON failure
// on it aborts immediately: fn is never invoked, and there is no retry.
//
// Retry backoff (mutateBackoff) is exponential from mutateBackoffBase,
// doubling each attempt, then jittered uniformly over [d/2, d). At the
// current mutateMaxAttempts (5) that produces 4 waits — attempts 1-4, none
// after the final attempt — of roughly [5,10) + [10,20) + [20,40) + [40,80)
// ms, jittered; mutateBackoffCap bounds the doubling but only engages if
// mutateMaxAttempts is ever raised. The wait is wall-clock (time.NewTimer),
// not ctx.Now()-driven — Mutate reasons about real contention, not
// simulated time. The wait is itself ctx-aware, using the house
// time.NewTimer + select-on-ctx.Done() pattern (as in lib/job's scheduler
// loop): cancellation observed at the top of a loop iteration, or during the
// backoff wait, returns errors.Join(ctx.Err(), lastErr), so callers can
// errors.Is for both context.Canceled and the conflict sentinel that
// triggered the wait. Exhausting mutateMaxAttempts returns the last conflict
// error wrapped with the attempt count (still errors.Is-matchable). That
// last conflict may be any of: ErrCASConflict, ErrLockNotAvailable,
// ErrDuplicateID (MutateOrInsert's insert branch), or ErrObjectNotFound
// (MutateOrInsert's delete-race absorption, below).
//
// Wrong shard-key hint on a must-exist Mutate: shardKeys is a query-routing
// hint for SelectByID only. A wrong hint makes an existing row look absent,
// so Mutate returns ErrObjectNotFound immediately — the same failure mode as
// a genuinely missing id. See MutateOrInsert's doc comment for the
// analogous, but self-healing, may-create case.
//
// SQLite (the test-only engine) never raises the Postgres NOWAIT SQLSTATE —
// see SafeUpdate's doc comment (update.go) for why cross-connection SQLite
// contention is not actually reachable in this package's test harness.
//
// No functional options: the variadic slot is already shardKeys; additive
// later if a caller need appears.

// MutateOrInsert is Mutate for a row that may not exist yet: if id is
// missing, seed builds the initial object, fn is applied to it, and the
// result is inserted; if id already exists, MutateOrInsert behaves exactly
// like Mutate (seed is never called). fn thus runs on BOTH branches — put
// merge/validation logic in one place there — while seed's only job is
// producing the initial base for a not-yet-existing row. Both must be
// pure/retry-safe, same contract as Mutate's fn: no irreversible or
// externally visible side effects. seed may run once per insert-branch
// attempt (never on the update branch).
//
// A nil seed degrades MutateOrInsert to must-exist semantics — Mutate itself
// is exactly `mutateLoop(ctx, id, nil, fn, shardKeys...)`. A nil fn, unlike
// a nil seed, is not blessed: it is a plain error, checked before any I/O.
//
// Return contract, the no-op skip, freshness, and retry/backoff mechanics
// are identical to Mutate's — see its doc comment. The no-op skip applies
// only to the update branch; the insert branch always writes (there is
// nothing yet-persisted to compare a freshly-seeded row against).
//
// ID guard: on the insert branch, fn's returned object's DBKey().ID must
// equal id — unlike SafeUpdate, plain Insert has no ID guard of its own, so
// MutateOrInsert checks it. A mismatch aborts immediately with a plain
// error: no retry, no row written under either ID.
//
// ShardKey guard: on the insert branch, fn's returned object's
// DBKey().ShardKey must equal seed's — mirroring SafeUpdate's own from/to
// shard-mismatch rejection on the update branch, which this combinator's
// update branch already inherits. Without this guard, an fn that changes
// the shard-key field after seed would make Insert land on a shard other
// than the one SelectByID checked, and could create a true cross-shard
// duplicate. A mismatch aborts immediately with a plain error: no retry, no
// row written under either shard.
//
// Duplicate-key race: if another caller inserts the same id between this
// attempt's SelectByID and its own Insert, the resulting duplicate-key error
// (see isDuplicateInsertErr) is absorbed into the same mutateMaxAttempts
// budget and mutateBackoff wait as a CAS conflict, rather than surfaced
// as a raw driver error — the next attempt's SelectByID normally finds the
// row the other caller just created and converges through the ordinary
// update branch from there. Duplicate-key EXHAUSTION specifically is not
// deterministically constructible in a single-threaded test: after one
// collision, the next attempt's SelectByID necessarily finds the racer's
// row and moves to the update branch, so the exhaustion test exercises the
// CAS path instead (a racer Update on a pre-existing row) — same budget,
// same code path as Mutate's own exhaustion behaviour, reached through this
// wrapper.
//
// Delete race (the mirror image): if another caller deletes the row between
// this attempt's SelectByID and SafeUpdate's guarded read, the resulting
// ErrObjectNotFound is likewise absorbed into the same budget and backoff —
// our write never committed, so retrying into the insert branch is
// linearizable as "their delete, then our insert", ordinary upsert
// semantics. Only MutateOrInsert absorbs this; must-exist Mutate still
// aborts with ErrObjectNotFound, as its contract requires. This absorption
// assumes the race is transient: a permanently misfiled row — one whose
// ShardKey routes to a shard other than the one it actually lives on,
// unsupported-resharding territory — recurs on every attempt and simply
// exhausts the budget instead of converging.
//
// Wrong shard-key hint: shardKeys is a query-routing hint for SelectByID
// only, never validated against the object's real ShardKey. A wrong hint
// fails safely — it does not heal, and it does not corrupt: every attempt
// misses the existing row on SelectByID (routed by the hint), takes the
// insert branch, and Insert (which routes by the object's own ShardKey, not
// the hint) hits the row's real shard and duplicate-key-fails there —
// exhausting the budget with ErrDuplicateID, never creating a duplicate
// row. The one caller-bug this cannot defend against is seed itself
// building the object with a different ShardKey than the existing row's —
// but that specific case is now guarded too (see the ShardKey guard above):
// it aborts immediately instead of reaching Insert.
//
// SQL-NULL-object row (deliberately unresolved, not a bug): a runtime row
// whose "object" column is SQL NULL (an out-of-band state; see the
// package's live-object guard elsewhere) reads as absent to SelectByID, so
// every MutateOrInsert attempt takes the insert branch and collides with
// the still-present primary key — exhausting with ErrDuplicateID rather
// than reviving the row, even though a caller reading the id would see it
// as absent. This is intentional: silently resurrecting such a row via a
// may-create combinator would contradict the deliberate-delete rationale
// that shape defends elsewhere in this package (upstream issue #15 will
// forbid the state outright). Upsert, not MutateOrInsert, is the primitive
// that can overwrite a SQL-NULL-object row.
//
// Vanished row: like Mutate, a post-write re-read that comes back empty
// returns ErrObjectVanished — see its doc comment for why not
// ErrObjectNotFound.
