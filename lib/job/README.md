# Job Package (job)

A multi-tenant, database-synchronized job scheduler that ensures exactly-once execution across multiple application instances.

## Overview

This package provides a recurring job scheduler backed by the `convDB` database layer. Jobs are registered in-memory with an associated function, while their schedule state (next run time, repeat interval) is persisted in the database. When multiple instances of the application run concurrently, the database acts as the coordination layer -- only one instance executes a given job at any point in time, using pessimistic locking.

## Key Features

- **Multi-instance safety**: Database locks prevent duplicate execution across instances
- **Multi-tenancy**: Jobs are scoped to tenants, isolated from each other
- **Persistent scheduling**: Job schedules survive restarts via database persistence
- **Periodic sync**: In-memory state syncs with the database every minute to pick up changes from other instances
- **Immediate wake-up**: Registering a new job wakes the background loop immediately
- **Panic recovery**: A panicking job function does not crash the background goroutine
- **Graceful shutdown**: Context cancellation cleanly stops the scheduler

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialise the Job Runner

```go
err := job.Initialise(ctx, "my_vault")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
```

This creates the database tables (via `convDB`) and starts the background goroutine.

### 2. Register a Job

```go
err := job.Register(
    ctx,
    "my-tenant",                          // tenant
    "daily-cleanup",                      // job ID (unique per tenant)
    time.Now().Add(1*time.Hour),          // first run time
    24*time.Hour,                         // repeat interval
    func(ctx convCtx.Context) error {
        // your job logic here
        return nil
    },
)
```

If the job already exists in the database (e.g. from a previous run), the persisted schedule is used and the function is attached to it.

### 3. Unregister a Job

```go
err := job.Unregister(ctx, "my-tenant", "daily-cleanup")
```

Removes the job from both in-memory state and the database.

### 4. Shut Down

```go
err := job.Cancel()
```

Stops the background goroutine. The scheduler can be re-initialised later.

## How It Works

### Background Loop

The scheduler runs a single background goroutine that repeats the following cycle:

1. **Sync** -- Every minute, fetch all jobs from the database for each known tenant and merge into the in-memory map. This picks up schedule changes made by other instances (e.g. updated `NextRunAt` after execution).

2. **Execute** -- For each job where `NextRunAt <= now` and the job function is available locally, attempt to acquire a database lock. If the lock is acquired, execute the job; if not, skip it (another instance is handling it).

3. **Sleep** -- Compute the time until the next job is due or the next sync interval (whichever is sooner) and sleep until then.

### Multi-Instance Coordination

When a job is due:

1. Instance A and Instance B both detect `NextRunAt <= now`
2. Both attempt `INSERT INTO lock_table ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`
3. Only one succeeds (`RowsAffected == 1`) -- that instance executes the job
4. The other gets `RowsAffected == 0` and silently skips
5. After execution, the winning instance updates `NextRunAt` in the database and releases the lock
6. On the next sync cycle, all instances pick up the updated schedule

### Job Functions

Job functions (`JobFunc`) are `func(convCtx.Context) error`. They:

- Receive the scheduler's context (with cancellation wired in)
- Should check `ctx.Done()` for graceful shutdown during long operations
- Errors are logged but do not prevent schedule advancement (to avoid tight retry loops)
- Panics are recovered and logged

### Schedule Advancement

After execution, `NextRunAt` is advanced by `RepeatEvery`. If multiple intervals were missed (e.g. instance was down), the schedule jumps forward to the next future time rather than executing all missed runs.

## Types

```go
type JobID string                           // Unique job identifier (per tenant)
type JobFunc func(convCtx.Context) error    // Job function signature
```

## API

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `Initialise(ctx, vault)` | Start the scheduler with the given database vault |
| `Register(ctx, tenant, id, startAt, repeatEvery, fn)` | Register a recurring job |
| `Unregister(ctx, tenant, id)` | Remove a job |
| `Cancel()` | Stop the scheduler |

## Configuration

The package uses `convDB` for persistence. Database connections must be configured via the config system for the vault passed to `Initialise()`. See the [db package README](../db/README.md) for configuration details.

## Error Handling

- `Initialise` returns an error if the scheduler is already running
- `Register` returns an error if the scheduler is not initialised or if a job with the same ID already exists for the tenant
- `Unregister` returns an error if the tenant or job does not exist
- `Cancel` returns an error if the scheduler is not running
- Background errors (DB sync failures, lock errors, job execution errors) are logged via `ctx.Logger()` and do not stop the scheduler

## Thread Safety

- All public functions are safe for concurrent use (protected by `sync.Mutex`)
- Job execution happens outside the mutex to avoid blocking `Register`/`Unregister` calls
- Database locks provide cross-instance synchronization
