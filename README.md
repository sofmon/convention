# Convention

Convention over configuration (CoC) definition and recommended implementation for applications build within the Sofmon group.

See documentation for [convention v1](./v1/).

## Convention over Configuration

"Convention over configuration" (CoC), sometimes also referred to as "coding by convention," is a software design principle that is often associated with modern software development frameworks and libraries, especially in the context of web development. This principle emphasizes the use of sensible defaults and standardized naming and structure conventions to reduce the need for explicit configuration and minimize the amount of code developers have to write.

Here are some of the benefits of Convention over Configuration:
- **Reduced Boilerplate Code**: CoC reduces the amount of boilerplate or repetitive code that developers need to write. By following established conventions, developers can focus on writing the unique, application-specific code, rather than configuring every aspect of the framework or library.
- **Simplicity and Readability**: CoC promotes simplicity and readability in code. When developers adhere to well-defined conventions, it becomes easier for other team members to understand and work with the codebase. This can lead to more maintainable and collaborative development.
- **Faster Development**: With CoC, developers can get up and running quickly. They don't need to spend excessive time configuring various components or making decisions about naming and structure. This can speed up the development process and reduce time-to-market for applications.
- **Consistency**: CoC enforces consistency in codebases. When everyone follows the same conventions, it ensures that the codebase has a uniform structure and style. This consistency can prevent common errors and make it easier to spot and fix issues.
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Developers don't have to keep track of numerous configuration settings and options. Instead, they can rely on the defaults and conventions, which reduces cognitive load and the likelihood of configuration errors.
- **Compatibility and Interoperability**: CoC can promote compatibility and interoperability between different parts of an application or between different software components. When components follow the same conventions, they are more likely to work seamlessly together.
- **Lower Learning Curve**: For newcomers to a project or framework, CoC can lower the learning curve. They can quickly grasp how things are organized and named, making it easier for them to start contributing effectively.
- **Easier Maintenance**: Over time, maintaining a codebase with CoC can be less challenging. Because the code follows established patterns, making changes or updates is less error-prone, and it's easier to predict how changes will affect the application.
- **Community and Ecosystem**: Many open-source frameworks and libraries adhere to CoC principles. This means that developers can benefit from a vibrant community and a rich ecosystem of plugins, extensions, and documentation that follow the same conventions.

However, it's important to note that CoC may not be suitable for all projects. In some cases, projects may have unique requirements that cannot be easily accommodated by conventions alone, and explicit configuration may be necessary. The choice between Convention over Configuration and explicit configuration depends on the specific needs of the project and the development team's preferences.
